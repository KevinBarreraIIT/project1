   <h1>Other stuff I do:</h1>
   
   <p>I play video games on both PC and Console (mostly Fifa these days because soccer)</p>
   
   <p>I like to practice guitar and ukelele, and once in a while I'll practice piano.</p>
   
   <p>I love collecting and playing retro video games, with my favorite being Mega Man 2 on the NES.</p>
   
   <p>And in general, I love music and hanging out with friends.</p>
